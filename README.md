just making notes here for remote sensing for my own reference ::))

`What is Remote Sensing?`
The science and art of **obtaining information** about an object, area, or phenomenon through the analysis of data acquired by a device that is not in contact with the object, area, or phenomenon under investigation.

**why Remote Sensing?**
- Systematic data collection
- Information about three dimensions of real objects
- Repeatability
- Global coverage
- The only solution sometimes for the otherwise inaccessible areas
- Multipurpose information

**Before moving forward lets know some properties and imp things**

`What is Electromagnetic Radiation?`

**There are 2 theories:**
      
      WAVE theory: consider electromagnetic energy as a harmonic, sinusoidal wave
      
      PARTICLE theory: consider electromagnetic radiation as consisting of many discreet units photons.

`EMR propagation as wave`

An electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave in which the electric field and the magnetic field at any point and time in the wave are perpendicular to each other as well as to the direction of propagation.

    **Terms associated with the wave theory**
- Crest: The highest point of the wave.
- Trough : The lowest point of the wave.
- Wavelength : The distance between two identical points on the wave.
- Frequency : The number of wavelenghts that pass a point in a set period of time.
